<h1>about me</h1>
    <p>Long time tech-enthusiast, first time coder, I am a full student of full stack web development at the UCONN coding bootcamp. I currently work mostly with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while still learning more languages. Aside from the code, I speak english, spanish, and a bit of Norwegian. I love to travel, play music, learn about new technologies, and code. <br> <br> Here, on my website I would like to show you some of the work i've made so far. It is my hope to keep learning more long after graduating this boot camp. </p>
